> [!WARNING]
> Infrarust is currently in active development. This project is a Rust implementation inspired by [Infrared](https://infrared.dev/), focusing on performance and enhanced features.

A blazing fast Minecraft reverse proxy that allows you to expose multiple Minecraft servers through a single port. It uses domain/subdomain-based routing to direct clients to specific Minecraft servers.

## Key Features

- [x] Efficient Reverse Proxy
  - [x] Wildcard Domain Support
  - [x] Multi-Domain Routing
  - [x] Direct IP Connection Support
- [x] Authentication Modes
  - [x] ClientOnly Mode (only works with vanilla < 1.20)
  - [x] Passthrough Mode
  - [x] Offline Mode
  - [x] ServerOnly Mode
- [x] Performance Optimizations
  - [x] Connection Pooling
  - [x] Zero-copy packet forwarding
  - [x] Status Caching
- [x] Security Features
  - [x] Rate Limiting
  - [x] Basic DDoS Protection
  - [x] Advanced Ban System (IP, UUID, Username)
- [x] Container Integration
  - [x] Docker Auto-Discovery
  - [x] Real-time Container Monitoring
- [x] Command Line Interface
  - [x] Player Management
  - [x] Ban Management
  - [x] Status Monitoring
- [x] Basic Telemetry and Monitoring

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.84+ and Cargo

### Installation

```bash
# From source
git clone https://github.com/shadowner/infrarust
cd infrarust
cargo build --release

# Or via cargo
cargo install infrarust
```

### Basic Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
bind: "0.0.0.0:25565"
file_provider:
  proxies_path: ["./proxies"]
  watch: true  # Enable hot-reload
```

And create your server configurations in the `proxies` directory:

```yaml
# proxies/my-server.yml
domains:
  - "hub.minecraft.example.com"
addresses:
  - "localhost:25566"
proxyMode: "passthrough" # Options: passthrough, client_only, offline, server_only
```

## Documentation

Visit [infrarust.dev](https://infrarust.dev) for complete documentation:

- [Quick Start Guide](https://infrarust.dev/quickstart/)
- [Configuration Reference](https://infrarust.dev/quickstart/configuration)
- [Docker Integration](https://infrarust.dev/features/docker)
- [Ban System](https://infrarust.dev/features/ban-system)
- [CLI Commands](https://infrarust.dev/features/cli/)

## Docker Integration

Infrarust can automatically detect and proxy Minecraft servers running in Docker containers:

```yaml
docker_provider:
  docker_host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
  label_prefix: "infrarust"
  watch: true
```

Container configuration is done through Docker labels:
```
infrarust.enable=true
infrarust.domains=mc.example.com
```

## Telemetry & Monitoring

Infrarust provides comprehensive telemetry through OpenTelemetry integration, including metrics, traces, and logs. The project includes a ready-to-use monitoring stack in the [docker/monitoring](docker/monitoring) directory.

### Quick Start Monitoring

```bash
cd docker/monitoring
docker compose up -d
```

This will start:

- Grafana (http://localhost:3000)
- Prometheus (http://localhost:9090)
- Tempo (Traces)
- OpenTelemetry Collector

### Available Metrics

- Connection metrics (active connections, errors, latency)
- Backend metrics (server status, response times)
- System metrics (CPU, memory, threads)
- Minecraft-specific metrics (protocol errors, player count)

## Performance

Infrarust leverages Rust's performance capabilities:

- Minimal memory footprint (~10MB base)
- Low CPU utilization
- Efficient async I/O handling
- Zero-copy packet forwarding when possible

> [!NOTE]
> This project was initiated as a learning experience in advanced Rust programming, with continuous improvements and optimizations expected as development progresses.
